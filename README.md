# SmartMoM
SmartMoM is about capturing minutes of meeting in a smart way. 
Our app listens to your conversations, converts speech into text
and it does sentimental analysis on the text. Then it stores all 
the data back on the mongolabs database-as-a-service.

You can run this app on your computer also.
Steps:
1. Download the .zip file and extract into a folder.
2. Make sure you have node installed on your system.
3. Open Command prompt and cd to the project folder.
4. Run "npm install". 
5. Thats all you need to run the application through 
   your localhost.
